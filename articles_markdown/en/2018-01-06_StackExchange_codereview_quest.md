## The StackExchange quest ##

### What is [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/)? ### 
[StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) is a community of Q&A websites, the best known being [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), a Q&A website for developers having broken code. It aims to be a reference of knowledge, to help people learn.

The format of the Q&A is simple, you ask a question, try to explain clearly your problem and then hopefully someone will answer your question. If your question is well formatted, ask something not asked previously, and follow the rules of the [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) community where you ask the question, some people might vote for your question, to show that the question is an interesting one. When people vote for your questions (and your answers to other questions), you gain points which acts as a reputation. The more reputation you have, the more privilege you gain (like voting, downvoting, editing other posts, deleting posts ...).  

The goal of StackExchange is to be community-driven, so high reputation people are moderators for the community. Each community has his own reputation score, so someone with a [high reputation](https://stackexchange.com/users/11683/jon-skeet?tab=accounts) on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for example might be at 611 reputation on [CodeReview](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/) (and therefore is a moderator on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) but not on [CodeReview](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/)).

The communities have a very wide appeal, ranging from [code reviews](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/), [homebrewing](https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/), [emacs](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/), [lego](https://bricks.stackexchange.com/), [music](https://music.stackexchange.com/), to [aviation](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/). There are 170 of them, varying wildly in size and subject. Check them out [here](https://stackexchange.com/sites#).

### What about that mighty Quest? ###

Yes, so the title of this post is "The StackExchange Quest", so let's talk about that. I'd like to be a better developer, and to help me accomplish that goal, I'll start doing [code reviews](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/). In short it's reading someone else's code, maybe even running it, try to reason about it and apply constructive criticism. It should help me improve in a few areas:

- Read code that I did not write and understand it. It's something I do almost daily at work (in PHP and Javascript) but still, it's hard and I need as much practice as I can get.
- Know the best practices for Java and Python.
- Improve code, which is sometimes harder than understand code.
- Communicate in English because the [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) network is mostly in English.

In the span of 30 days, starting today (06/01/2018) I'll aim to do at least 5 reviews, aiming for a lowish count but as high quality as I can. Answering those questions is to help people reading it so I must strive for quality, more so than quality.

Another motivation is to improve [my reputation](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/87312/julien-rous%c3%a9) on [CodeReview](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/). Gamification helps motivation 

### Conclusion ###

Quest is on, I'll do a debriefing in 30 days.
